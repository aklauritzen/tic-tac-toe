# Tic Tac Toe
Live demo: https://tic-tac-toe-aklauritzen.netlify.app

Classic Tic Tac Toe build with React.

## Concept
* Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
* Indicates when a player has won the game,
* Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
* Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.

The project is inspired by React Tutorial: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

## I have added new features to the game
* Toggle button to sort move history
* Added 2 x loops to create the square board (instead of hardcoding the board)
* Highlight selected move in the history list
* History item now shows move position (col/row)
